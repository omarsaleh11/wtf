                    <h1>King Cobra</h1>
                    <p>The king cobra—one of the most venomous snakes on the planet—can literally "stand up" and look a
                        full-grown person in
                        the eye. When confronted, they can lift up to a third of its body off the ground and still move
                        forward to attack.

                    <h1>Body</h1>
                    <p>
                        Fortunately, king cobras are shy and will avoid humans whenever possible. It will also flare out
                        its iconic hood and
                        emit a hiss that sounds almost like a growling dog.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        King cobras can reach 18 feet in length, making them the longest of all venomous snakes.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Defense</h1>
                    <p>When threatened, king cobras spread their hoods to make themselves look bigger and raise their
                        heads as high as 6 feet off the ground. But those aren't the only threatening tools in their
                        arsenal: They also use sound to intimidate. Threatened kings take a deep breath and then rapidly
                        exhale, forcing a burst of air through the tracheal diverticula in their respiratory tract which
                        acts like a resonating chamber, resulting in a sound that one scientist compared to the growl of
                        “an angry German shepherd.” It's much scarier than your standard issue hiss.</p>
                    <h1>Venom</h1>
                    <p>
                        King cobras live mainly in the rain forests and plains of India, southern China, and Southeast
                        Asia, and their coloring
                        can vary greatly from region to region. They are comfortable in a variety of habitats, including
                        forests, bamboo
                        thickets, mangrove swamps, high-altitude grasslands, and in rivers.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Diet</h1>
                    <p>This species feeds mainly on other snakes, venomous and nonvenomous. They will also eat lizards,
                        eggs, and small
                        mammals.</p>
                    <h1>Mating</h1>
                    <p>Like many other species of animal, male king cobras fight over females during breeding season.
                        First, the snakes size
                        each other up, raising their heads as high as 4 feet off the ground. Then, they wrestle. Bodies
                        intertwined, the snakes
                        try to pin one another to the ground. (There's no biting involved — these snakes are largely
                        immune to their own venom.)
                        When one of the participants is finally pinned, he leaves.</p>

                    <h1>Female Job</h1>
                    <p>Snakes, by human standards, are not model parents: 70 percent of snake species lay eggs, usually
                        in a convenient hole or
                        crevice, and many will abandon their clutches immediately. But the king cobra is an exception.
                        The reptile builds a
                        nest. First, the female gathers leaves, using her coils as a makeshift rake. After she lays 20
                        to 30 eggs in the middle,
                        she gathers more leaves, layering them over her clutch (the decomposition of the leaves helps
                        keep the eggs warm). The
                        process can take four full days to complete, after which the female curls up on top of the nest
                        for the next two or
                        three months until the eggs begin to hatch. Females don't eat the entire time they're guarding
                        the nest and are
                        unusually aggressive, lashing out at pretty much anything that comes too close—but just before
                        the eggs hatch, they take
                        off.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Nest</h1>
                    <p>They are the only snakes in the world that build nests for their eggs, which they guard
                        ferociously until the hatchlings
                        emerge.</p>
                    <h1>Activate</h1>
                    <p>While many true cobras are crepuscular, king cobras snakes are diurnal, meaning they're most
                        active during daytime.
                        After sunset, they take shelter under logs, buttress roots, or termite mounds.</p>
                    <h1>Snake Charmers</h1>
                    <p>King cobras may be best known as the species of choice for the snake charmers of South Asia.
                        Although cobras can hear,
                        they are actually deaf to ambient noises, sensing ground vibrations instead. Snake charming is
                        “often a sad con game in
                        which an exhausted cobra is put on the defensive, yet conditioned (with pain) not to strike the
                        flutist,” Smithsonian’s
                        National Zoo says.</p>
                    <h1>Threats</h1>
                    <p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the king cobra as vulnerable to
                        extinction. These snakes
                        face a variety of threats stemming from human activities. Heavy deforestation in Southeast Asia
                        has destroyed the
                        habitats of many king cobras, while they are also harvested in large numbers for skin, food, and
                        medicinal purposes.
                        They are also collected for the international pet trade. King cobras are also persecuted by
                        humans who fear their
                        menacing reputation.</p>
                    <h1>Conservation</h1>
                    <p>In Vietnam, the king cobra is a protected species. Protected areas within this snake’s geographic
                        range likely provide
                        some safeguards, and organizations like the King Cobra Conservancy work to better understand the
                        behaviors of the
                        species in order to educate the public and protect the snake’s habitat. The Indian government
                        implants microchips in
                        captive king cobras to allow officials to identify any snakes that have newly been taken
                        captive—which has been
                        outlawed—in order to reduce the illegal wildlife trade.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Lineage</h1>
                    <p>
                        Despite that common name, king cobras are not classified as true cobras, which belong to the
                        genus Naja. The king cobra
                        is the sole member the genus Ophiophagus; genetic evidence suggests that these big snakes are
                        more closely related to
                        the mambas of sub-Saharan Africa than to true cobras.
                    </p>
                    <p>Physically, there are many things that set king cobras apart from true ones: Kings have
                        proportionally narrower hoods
                        than Naja species do; Ophiophagus’s head is larger relative to its body size; and at the base of
                        the neck, king cobras
                        have a pair of matching, elongated occipital scales, which are absent in Naja cobras.</p>
                    <h1><span>Is King Cobra</span> Cannibalism!??</h1>
                    <p>
                        It may be shy and retreat in front of humans, but this snake its main meal is the other snakes.
