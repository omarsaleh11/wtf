                        <P>
                            Ring-billed Gulls are often found in and around urban, suburban, and agricultural areas. In
                            coastal areas, Ring-billed
                            Gulls frequent estuaries, beaches, mudflats, and coastal waters. In winter, these birds are
                            common around docks,
                            wharves, and harbors. Ring-billed Gulls are more commonly seen inland than most other gull
                            species. They can be found at
                            reservoirs, lakes, ponds, streams, landfills, parking lots, and shopping malls.
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            Able to thrive on almost any available source of nutrition, Ring-billed Gulls eat mostly
                            fish,
                            insects, earthworms,
                            rodents, grain, and garbage. Common fish prey include alewife, smelt, nine-spined
                            stickleback,
                            and yellow perch; insect
                            meals feature primarily beetles, flies, dragonflies, and bugs. In the western U.S., many
                            Ring-billed Gull populations
                            find most of their food on farm fields, forgoing fish altogether. In addition to their more
                            common fare, Ring-billed
                            Gulls have been known to eat dates, cherries, blueberries, and strawberries, as well as
                            French
                            fries and other food
                            discarded—or left unguarded—by people.

                        <h1>Nesting</h1>
                        <p>
                            Ring-billed gulls nest in colonies numbering from 20 to tens of thousands of pairs. They
                            build
                            their nests on the ground
                            near freshwater, usually on low, sparsely vegetated terrain. They may nest on sandbars,
                            rocky
                            beaches, driftwood, bare
                            rock, concrete, or soil. They often choose sites near or underneath low plants to hide them
                            from
                            aerial predators. Nest
                            sites tend to be used for multiple seasons, by new or returning pairs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The male and female cooperate in constructing the nest—a scrape in the ground lined with
                            twigs,
                            sticks, grasses, leaves,
                            lichens, or mosses. Some nests are minimalist affairs with almost no lining. The nest's
                            outer
                            diameter ranges from about
                            10 to 25 inches, with an inner cup about 9 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep.

                        <p>
                            Ring-billed Gulls are strong, graceful flyers. They can race along at more than 40 miles per
                            hour, and they're adept at
                            snatching food from the air. You may see these birds hovering, soaring, or poised and
                            stationary
                            in the wind. Adults
                            play by repeatedly dropping objects, then swooping to catch them—perhaps honing their
                            hunting
                            moves. These gulls use a
                            wide variety of foraging methods: walking around on land; stamping their feet in shallow
                            water
                            to uncover small
                            invertebrates; skimming shallow water for small fish; nabbing insects out of the air. They
                            steal
                            food from other birds,
                            hunt for small rodents, and scavenge along beaches, parks, and garbage dumps. Birds in large
                            nonbreeding groups usually
                            space themselves evenly, about 3–6 feet apart. Like many other gull species, when
                            Ring-billed
                            Gulls are feeling
                            aggressive they'll lower their head, begin calling, and then raise their head up to their
                            shoulders. This can escalate
                            to an exaggerated toss of the head over the back while calling. To signal submission, a
                            Ring-billed Gull will draw its
                            head back in toward its shoulders and make shorter, calmer calls, sometimes tossing its head
                            up
                            or away from its
                            opponent as well.

                            with an estimated 3 to 4 million individuals (70 percent nesting in Canada).

                        <p>
                            Well there is little doubt about that however, In the Pacific Northwest researchers have
                            noticed
                            a disturbing trend: As sea temperatures rise, plankton have dropped
                            into lower, colder waters; fish have followed the plankton down. Gulls, which can no longer
                            find
                            enough food in shallow
                            waters, have turned to eating each other’s chicks.
